# ReliefChain — Backend Blockchain Connection Layer

This is the backend integration module connecting **ReliefChain** directly to the **Sui Mainnet** via the **Tatum Gateway RPC** using the modern `@mysten/sui` TypeScript SDK.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Specifications

* **Blockchain Network:** Sui Mainnet
* **Sui TypeScript SDK:** `@mysten/sui` (Official modern SDK - client, transactions, and cryptography exports)
* **RPC Gateway:** Tatum Gateway (`https://sui-mainnet.gateway.tatum.io`)
* **Module System:** ES Modules (ESM) with import/export syntax
* **Language:** TypeScript 5.x+ (NodeNext resolution)

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration (`.env`)

A `.env` file has been created at the root level of your workspace with the following settings:

```env
SUI_RPC_URL=https://sui-mainnet.gateway.tatum.io
TATUM_API_KEY=t-6a140233ac1249b94ca19bd2-ebdd89d3bed74aa8b0a02e0e
NETWORK=mainnet
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the `TATUM_API_KEY` secure. Never commit the `.env` file to a public repository.

## 🚀 How to Run and Test

You can run the connection test instantly using `tsx` (which supports native ESM execution for TS without manual build steps).

### 1. Execute Sandbox Connection Test
To execute the live verification script, run:
```bash
npx tsx src/testConnection.ts
```

This will automatically:
1. Initialize the **SuiJsonRpcClient** using the Tatum gateway and authorization headers.
2. Run a connectivity **Health Check** to ping the network.
3. Retrieve the **Latest Checkpoint Sequence Number** from the blockchain.
4. Retrieve and parse **Balances** (formatted in SUI and raw MIST) for a sample Sui Mainnet address.
5. Print a structural sample of owned objects mapping on-chain.

### 2. Manual TypeScript Build Compilation
To compile the TypeScript project into native ES Modules in the `dist` folder:
```bash
npx tsc
```

## 🔒 Error Handling Features

* **HTTP Status Checks:** Detects and wraps Tatum-specific errors like **HTTP 401 (Unauthorized Key)** and **HTTP 429 (Rate Limits Exceeded)** into descriptive, structured success-fail objects.
* **Structured Response Contracts:** All service functions return clean, uniform types matching `{ success: true, ... }` or `{ success: false, error: string }` avoiding unhandled promise rejections.
